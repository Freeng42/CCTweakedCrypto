## How to use:

First run CoinsBackend.py and make sure to change the filepath to the location of your json files.

After that, in Minecraft create a floppy disk for all users with the username being the labelname of the disk. After that let every user run request.lua on their PC. 
If you are just implementing the coins itself you are done now.

For the selling system:
Create a card for all sellers with any labelname you want, and a file named "ID" with the according ID you set in your JSON. Give the seller a computer and download Kassensystem.lua. To sell smth type "Kassensystem [Buyer] [Amount]" and the coins will be transferred.
